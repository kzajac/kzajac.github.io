I say high, you say low.
You say why and I say I don't know, oh no.
You say goodbye and I say hello
(Hello goodbye hello goodbye) hello hello
(Hello goodbye) I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello
(Hello goodbye hello goodbye) hello hello
(Hello goodbye) I don't know why you say goodbye
(Hello goodbye) I say hello.
